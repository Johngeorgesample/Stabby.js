# A JS framework for the edgy developer

Stabby.js lets you inject surprising JavaScript that will stab all users who interact with your product. Including this framework will not only optimize your website, but improve the lives of all it touches. Users will cower in fear of not knowing what may happen next. Around every turn is a knife waiting to stab the user to enhance their browsing experience, whether they like it or not. Stabby.js utilizes regular JavaScript syntax so developers do not need to waste time learning confusing sytax with dollar signs (looking at you, jQuery). What are you waiting for? Add Stabby.js to your repertoire of full-stack tools and watch your workflow productivity skyrocket exponentially.
